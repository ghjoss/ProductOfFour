The product Π of four integers in a consecutive arithmetic progression added to their difference, k,
raised to the fourth power is always a squared integer value. As an example:
sequence 2 4 6 8  (difference = 2): 2 * 4 * 6 * 8 + 2^4 = 384 + 16 = 400 = 20^2.

The program ProductOfFour.py computes and reports these integer sequences up to a maximum user specified 
maximum difference. This is computed across a range of starting numbers in the progression values, also user specified.

See DIFFERENCE_MAX and START_OF_SEQUENCE_MAX below.

For reference, see the on-line encyclopedia of integer sequences (OEIS) entry #A062938 (https://oeis.org/A062938)
This sequence, generalized for all differences (not only diff=1), is used in the code to evaluate the square roots 
without having to use the sqrt() function. 
The comments in A062938 note the general formula for this equation: 
	a(n) = n * (n+k) * (n+2k) * (n+3k) + k^4 is a perfect square for all integers: n,k.

For difference=1: The square roots of the results are the values in sequence https://oeis.org/A028387. 
For difference=2: The square roots of the results are the positive values in sequence https://oeis.org/A028875
For difference=3: The square roots of the results are the positive values in sequence https://oeis.org/A190576
For difference=4: The square roots of the results are the positive values in sequence https://oeis.org/A134594
For difference=5 through difference=25, no sequences were found referencing the
square roots.

ProductOfFour.py is a python program to calculate these squares for all starting integers from 1 to a max specified
in a parameters file, ProductOfFour.json. All progressive differences from 1 to to a difference(increment) 
specified in the parameters file. It runs for about 17 minutes on a PC with a core i7 CPU running at 2.4Ghz. The program 
can generate over 5000 files, but the maximum number of files can be limited by a setting in the 
parameters file. For each of the differences there are two files generated. One of these files is a .csv file 
and one is a simple text file. The file names start with "Diff_" and denote the difference. Thus for a difference 
of 1, the files are Diff_1.csv and Diff_1.txt.

Here is a snippet of a sample text report (first few lines). In this snippet, i is the first number in the 
four integers sequence and the increment is 1. The report shows the number generated by the arithmetic sequence's
product plus 1, the square root of that number and the prime factors of that square root.:

			------------------------------------------------------------------------
			difference == 1
			a(n) == (n x (n+1) x (n+2) x (n+3) + 1) -or-  a(n) == (n x 1 + (n + 1)²)²
				   n             a(n)             a(n)^0.5(factors)
			------------------------------------------------------------------------
				   1              25              5(5)
				   2             121              11(11)
				   3             361              19(19)
				   4             841              29(29)
				   5             1681             41(41)
				   6             3025             55(5 x 11)

For all differences > 1, each a(n), and its square root: 
	the end of the .txt report shows the cycle of taking those numbers modulo the increment. 
	Here is an example using the difference k=9:

		There are 872 prime square roots out of 5550 calculations.
		Maximum prime factor: 30796849 (at test for 948445908328801)
		Calculated number modulo 9 cycle:           1          7          0        * 4        4 *          0          7          1          0
		Square root modulo 9 cycle:                 1          4          0        * 7        7 *          0          4          1          0


There are additional files that track how many ways a(n) is derived from sequences. The files 
are Squares.txt and Squares_x.csv (x=1,2,...). The .csv files each contain 250,000 lines. 
For instance, see line 44 in squares1.txt. The number 43681 (209 * 209) is generated by:

			13 * 14 * 15 * 16 + 1   (start = 13,diff = 1: 1^4)
			8 * 13 * 18 * 23 + 625  (start = 8, diff = 5: 5^4)
			5 * 13 * 21 * 29 + 4096 (start = 5, diff = 8: 8^4)
			1 * 14 * 27 * 40 + 28561 (start = 1, diff = 13: 13 ^ 4)

The first number (before the colon) is the a(n) from files that contain a sequence that generates the 
number. The group following the colon (e.g. [43681, 209]) is the generated number and its square
root. The groups (e.g. [13,1,8,5,5,8,1,13]) are a list of starting number:difference pairs.
The file OddSequences.txt lists all of the numbers with an odd number of n/k sequences

	o	ProductOfFour.py will write to the subdirectory specified in the parameters .json file.

	o	In the notes that follow, the resultant number is referred to as a(n)where it is the result 
		based upon a starting progression number, n.

	o	The math involved:

		For number n, difference (increment) k:

		----
		Formula 1:
		----
		  n * (n+k) * (n + 2*k) * (n+3*k) + k^4
		= n* (n+2*k) * (n+k)*(n+3*k) + k^4
		= (n^2+2*k*n) * (n^2 + 4*k*n + 3*k^2) + k^4
		= (n^2*n^2 + 2*k*n*n^2) + (4*k*n*n^2 + 4*k*n*2*k*n) + (3*k^2 * n^2 + 3*k^2 * 2*k*n) +k^4
		= n^4		+ 2*k*n^3	 + 4*k*n^3	  + 8*k^2*n^2	 +	3*k^2*n^2	+ 6*k^3*n		 + k^4
		= n^4		+ 6*k*n^3				  + 11*k^2n^2					+ 6*k^3*n		 + k^4
		
		----
		Formula 2:
		----
		  (n*k + (n+k)^2)^2
		= (n*k + n^2 + 2*k*n + k^2)^2
		= (n*k + n^2 + 2*k*n + k^2) * (n*k + n^2 + 2*k*n + k^2)
		= (n*k*n*k + n^2*n*k + 2*k*n*n*k + k^2*n*k) + (n*k*n^2 + n^2*n^2 + 2*k*n*n^2 + k^2*n^2) + (n*k*2*k*n + n^2*2*k*n + 2*k*n*2*k*n + k^2*2*k*n) + (n*k*k^2 + n^2*k^2 + 2*k*n*k^2) + (k^2*k^2)
		= (k^2*n^2 + k*n^3 + 2*k^2*n^2 + k^3*n) + (k*n^3 + n^4 + 2*k*n^3 + k^2*n^2) + (2*k^2*n^2 + 2*k*n^3 + 4*k^2*n^2 + 2*k^3*n) + (k^3*n + k^2*n^2 + 2*k^3*n + k^4)
		= n^4 + (k*n^3 + k*n^3 + 2*k*n^3 + 2*k*n^3) + (k^2n^2 + 2*k^2*n^2 + k^2*n^2 + 2*k^2*n^2 + 4*k^2*n^2 + k^2*n^2) + (k^3*n + 2*k^3*n + k^*n + 2*k^3*n) + k^4
		= n^4 + 6*k*n^3 + 11*k^2n^2 + 6*k^3*n + k^4
		
		----
		Formula 3:
		----
		 (n^2 + 3*k*n + k^2)^2
		 = (n^2 + 3*k*n + k^2) * (n^2 + 3*k*n + k^2)
		 = n^4 + 3*k*n^3 + n^2*k^2 + 3*k*n^3 + 9*k^2*n^2 + 3*k^3*n + k^2+n^2 + 3*k^3*n + k^4
		 = n^4 + (3*k*n^3 + 3*k*n^3) + (n^2*k^2+9*k^2*n^2) + (3*k^3*n + 3*k^3*n) + k^4
		 = n^4 + 6*k*n^3 + 11*k^2*n^2 + 6*k^3*n + k^4


	o	As noted: the sequences with difference 1, as well as the sequences comprised of the square roots of the diff 1, diff 2, diff3 and diff 4 series, 
		are in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (oeis.org)

	o	When looking in squaresX.txt (X=1,2,3,...), the a(n) formed by starting integer n=1 and difference k=1 is not formed by any other 
		n:k combination. The same is true for n=2:k=2, n=3:k=3, ... n=10,k=10.  But n=11:k=11 is also formed by n=4:k=19 and n=19:k=4. The oddSequences.txt
		report shows all of the n:k combinations which also include n=k. There it can be more easily seen which results having n=k which may also have n <> k.

		Any number formed by an odd number of combinations will contain one instance of the starting integer in the arithmetic progression, n, and the
		difference, k, being equal. Conversely: every starting integer:difference of equal value (n=k) will have a result that has an odd number of n:k 
		combinations. The lines containing the n=k in the squaresX.txt files are denoted with an asterisk(*) as the first character in column 1.

	o	Question: is there any way to predetermine which result have an odd number of n:k,k:n combinations greater than 1?
		Conjecture: When an odd number of combinations (>1) is found, all the combinations containing multiples of the middle pair as
		their middle pairs will also contain an odd number of combinations >1.
		Example:
			366025(605): [19, 4, 11, 11, 4, 19]
			5856400(2420): [38, 8, 22, 22, 8, 38]
			29648025(5445): [57, 12, 33, 33, 12, 57]
			93702400(9680): [76, 16, 44, 44, 16, 76]
			...
			5358972025(73205): [229, 29, 209, 44, 121, 121, 44, 209, 29, 229]
			7589894400(87120): [228, 48, 132, 132, 48, 228]
		Conjecture: Within an odd combination with >1 pairs, the starts-of-sequence numbers "n" up to the middle pair will also have an
		odd combination with >1 pairs.
		Examples:
			366025(605): [==>19<==, 4, 11, 11, 4, 19]
			3258025(1805): [==>41<==, 1, 19, 19, 1, 41]
			70644025(8405): [==>76<==, 11, 41, 41, 11, 76]
			834054400(28880): [164, 4, 76, 76, 4, 164]     ... 76 is also a multiple of 19, see previous conjecture

			5856400(2420): [==>38<==, 8, 22, 22, 8, 38]		...22 is a multiple of 11
			52128400(7220): [==>82<==, 2, 38, 38, 2, 82] ...38 is a multiple of 19
			1130304400(33620): [152, 22, 82, 82, 22, 152]

			5358972025(73205): [==>229<==, 29, ==>209<==, 44, 121, 121, 44, 209, 29, 229] ...121 is a multiple of 11
			47700744025(218405): [451, 11, 361, 76, 311, 116, 284, 139, 209, 209, 139, 284, 116, 311, 76, 361, 11, 451]
			68751462025(262205): [484, 19, 229, 229, 19, 484]		

			However the start-of-sequence numbers following the middle pair do not necessarily have combinations >1. For example:
			58564000000(242000): [380, 80, 220, 220, ==>80<==, 380]
			1024000000(32000): [80, 80]
			521284000000(722000): [820, 20, 380, 380, 20, 820] ...380 is a multiple of 19

		Conjecture: The sequence of primes s.t. the n/k combinations is an odd number >=3 matches all or part the OEIS sequences: A038872, A045468, A141158, A064739,
					A076518, A336043
																												
	o	for n=k, the square root of the result a(n)^0.5 is 5 * n^2. Proof: By formula 2, a(n)^0.5= n*k + (n+k)^2. For k=n this becomes n^2 + (2*n)^2 = n^2 + 4*n^2 = 5 * n^2

	o	As noted, for n=k a(n)'s square root is 5 n^2.  For n-1:k+1 and n+1:k-1 the square root of the result is 5*n^2 - 1.  Proof: for k=n, n-1:k+1 = n-1:n+1. 
		Again using Formula 2, the square root of the result is (n-1)*(n+1) + (n-1 + n + 1)^2 = n^2 - 1 + (2*n)^2 = 5*n^2 - 1 
	
	o	For every n=x,k=y pair that generates a number, there exists an n=y,k=x pair that generates the same number. Proof: Using Formula 2 (n*k + (n+k)^2)^2 for the sequence 
		it is easy to see that swapping n and k does not change the result. This shows that whenever a set of n:k combinations has an odd number of entries, then one of those entries must 
		be where n=k.

				for the following product Π(n,k) = n * (n+k) * (n+2*k) * (n+3*k) and result a(n)[n,k] = Π(n,k) + k^4
			-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	o	For n=x,k=1 no a[n,1] has a prime factor of 2 or 3. Proof: Π(n,k) is divisible by both 2 and 3. Adding 1 means all results R are: a[n,1]=1(mod2) and R=1(mod3)

	o	for n=x,k=1 no R has a prime factor of 7. Proof: for n=1(mod7) Π(n,1)=4(mod7) and a[n,1]=5(mod7). For n=2(mod7) Π(n,1)=1(mod7)and a[n,1]=2(mod7). For n=3(mod7)
		Π(3,1) = 3(mod7) and a[n,1]=4(mod7). For n=4(mod7), 5(mod7), 6(mod7) and 0(mod7), Π(n,1) = 0(mod7) and a[n,1]=1(mod7).

	o	for n=x,k=2 no a[n,2] has a prime factor of 3. Proof: when Π(n,2) = 0(mod3) then a[n,2] = Π[n,2] + 2^4 = 1(mod3). If n=0 mod(3), then Π[n,2] = 0(mod3). 
		If n = 1(mod3) then (n+2) = 0(mod3) and Π(n,2) = 0(mod3). If n=2(mod3) then n+(2*2) = 0(mod3) and Π[n,2] = 0(mod3).

	o	for n=x,k=3: no a[n,k] has a prime factor of 2. Proof: Π[n,3] is even. Adding 81(3^4) makes the result odd. Odd numbers do not have 2 as a prime factor.

	o	Conjecture: In the Inc_1.txt file, note the first [1], second [2] and third [3] time a prime factor (pf) appears for a result a(n). Note n[1],n[2] and n[3].
					The next time that (pf) will appear will be at n[4] = n[3] + (n[2]-n[1]). n[5] = n[4] + (n[3] - n[2]). This repeats infinitely for each first
					occurence of a prime factor (pf).
					examples: 	(pf)=11:  n[1]=2, n[2]=6, n[3]=13.  n[4]=13 + (6-2)  = 17. n[5] = 17 + (13-6)  = 24.  n[6] = 24 + (17-13) = 28, ...
								(pf)=19:  n[1]=3, n[2]=13,n[3]=22.  n[4]=22 + (13-3) = 32. n[5] = 32 + (22-13) = 41.  n[6] = 41 + (32-22) = 51, ...
								(pf)=29:  n[1]=4, n[2]=22,n[3]=33.  n[4]=33 + (22-4) = 51. n[5] = 51 + (33-22) = 62.  n[6] = 62 + (51-33) = 80, ...
					The difference of n[m]-n[m-2] = (pf) for m >= 3.
		In other words: if p | n * (n+1)^2
						then p | (n + p - (2*n+3)) * 1 + (n + p - (2*n+3) + 1))^2
							 p | (n + p) * 1 + (n + p + 1)^2
							 p | (n + 2*p - (2*n+3)) * 1 + (n + 2*p - (2*n+3) + 1)^2

	For the following 4 bullet items, the generated .csv files contain columns for S(n), S(n)^.5 and S(n)+(a[n]^.5). Rather than use program run time
	for the S(n) calculations, ProductOfFour.py writes the Excel formulas for those values in each row.
	
	o	From https://oeis.org/A062938 comments: The sum of any three consecutive R, divided by 3, is a perfect square.  Thus (a[n-2]+a[n-1]+a[n]))/3 is
		a perfect square. This is also sequence https://oeis.org/A058031.
		For increment, k = 1, let a(n) be the result n * (n+1) * (n+2) * (n+3) + 1 and S1(n) = ((a(n-2)+a(n-1)+a(n)))/3)^.5
		Examples:
			n = 4, S1(4) = ((a(2)+a(3)+a(4))/3)^.5 = ((121 + 361 + 841) / 3)^.5 = 441^.5 = 21
			n = 10, S1(10) = ((a(8) + a(9) + a(10))/3)^.5 = ((7921 + 11881 + 17161))^.5 / 3 = 12321^.5 = 111
			n = 30, S1(30) = ((a(28) + a(29) + a(30))/3)^.5 = ((755161 + 863041 + 982081) / 3)^.5 = 866761^.5 = 931
	o	(S1(n) + a(n)^.5) / 2 is the square of n+1	
		Examples:
			n = 4, S1(4) = 21, a(4)^.5 = 29  21+29 = 50, 50/2 = 25, 25^.5 = 5
			n = 10, S1(10) = 111, a(10)^.5 = 131, 111+131 = 242 242/2 = 121, 121^.5 = 11
			n = 30, S1(30) = 931, a(30)^.5 = 991, 991+931 = 1922 1922/2 = 961, 961^.5 = 31
		The sequence S1(n) + a(n)^.5 is sequence https://oeis.org/A001105

	o	For increment k=2. Let a(n) be the result n * (n+2) * (n+4) * (n+6) + 16,  S2(n) = ((a(n) + a(n-2) + a(n-4)) / 3)^.5. 
		Examples:
			n = 5, S2(5) = (a(5) + a(3) + a(1)) / 3)^.5 = ((3481 + 961 + 121) / 3)^.5 = 1521^.5 = 39 
			n = 11, S2(11) = ((a(11) + a(9) + a(7)) / 3)^.5 = ((36481 + 19321 + 9025) / 3)^.5 = 21609^.5 = 147
			n = 21, S2(11) = ((a(21) + a(19) + a(17)) / 3)^.5 = ((326041 + 229441 + 156025) / 3)^.5 = 237169^.5 = 487
	o	(S2[n] + a[n]^.5) / 2 is the square of n+2
		Examples:
			n = 5, S2(5) = 39, a(5)^.5 = 59, 39 + 59 = 98, 98/2 = 49, 49^.5 = 7
			n = 11, S2(11) = 147, a(11)^.5 = 191, 191 + 147 = 338, 338 / 2 = 169, 169^.5 = 13
			n = 21, S2(21) = 487, a(21)^.5 = 571, 487 + 571 = 1058, 1058 / 2 = 529, 529^.5 = 23
