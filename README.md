The product π of four integers in a consecutive aritmetic sequence (difference = "increment")
added to the increment integer value raised to the fourth power is always a squared integer
value. As an example:
sequence 2 4 6 8  (increment = 2): 2 * 4 * 6 * 8 + 2^4 = 384 + 16 = 400

This program computes and reports these integer sequences up to a maximum user specified increment.
This is done across a range of sequence values, also user specified.

See INCREMENT_MAX and START_OF_SEQUENCE_MAX below.

See the on-line encyclopedia of integer sequences #A062938 (https://oeis.org/A062938)
This sequence, generalized for all increments (not only inc=1), is used in the
code to evaluate the square roots without having to use the sqrt() function. 
The comments in A062938 note the general formula for this equation: 
	n * (n+k) * (n+2k) * (n+3k) + k^4 is a perfect square.

For increment=1: The square roots of the results are the values in sequence https://oeis.org/A028387. 
For increment=2: The square roots of the results are the positive values in sequence https://oeis.org/A028875
For increment=3: The square roots of the results are the positive values in sequence https://oeis.org/A190576
For increment=4: The square roots of the results are the positive values in sequence https://oeis.org/A134594
For increment=5 through increment=25, no sequences were found referencing the
square roots.

ProductOfFour.py is a python program to calculate these squares for all starting integers from 1 to 5550
and all progressive differences from 1 to 2000. It runs for about 17 minutes on a PC with a core i7 CPU
running at 2.4Ghz. The program generates over 5000 files. For each of the 2000 differences there are
two files generated. One of these files is a .csv file and one is a simple text file. The file names start 
with "Inc_" and denote the difference. Thus for a difference (increment) of 1, the files are Inc_1.csv and 
Inc_1.txt.

Here is a snippet of a sample text report (first few lines). In this snippet, i is the first number in the 
four integers sequence and the increment is 1. The report shows the number generated by the sequence product plus 1, 
the square root of that number and the prime factors of that square root.:

			------------------------------------------------------------------------
			increment == 1
			num == (n x (n+1) x (n+2) x (n+3) + 1) -or-  num == (n x 1 + (n + 1)²)²
				   i             num              num^0.5(factors)
			------------------------------------------------------------------------
				   1              25              5(5)
				   2             121              11(11)
				   3             361              19(19)
				   4             841              29(29)
				   5             1681             41(41)
				   6             3025             55(5 x 11)

For all increments > 1, each result and its square root: the end of the .txt report shows the 
cycle of taking those numbers modulo the increment. Here is an example using the increment 9:

		There are 872 prime square roots out of 5550 calculations.
		Maximum prime factor: 30796849 (at test for 948445908328801)
		Calculated number modulo 9 cycle:           1          7          0        * 4        4 *          0          7          1          0
		Square root modulo 9 cycle:                 1          4          0        * 7        7 *          0          4          1          0


In addition to the above pairs of files ProductOfFour.py creates three text files related to the prime
factors of the square roots:
	o	PrimesInFiles.txt: this is summarized by the files Inc_1.txt - Inc_1200.txt. Whenever a prime factor is noted in a file, if it is the
		first time that prime factor has been seen, then it is associated with that file along with the line number where it occured.
		
			d:\Source\PythonApps\ProductOfFourSheet\Pof4_Output\Inc_1.txt

		In the above sample, 5 was seen for the first time as a prime factor of a square root on line 6 of the file. Note that the line 
		numbers include the five header lines (see above) which are repeated every 45 lines. Note that this is ordered by the line number.
	o 	PrimesInFilesSorted.txt: this is similar to the PrimesInFiles.txt file, but is sorted by the prime factors.

	o	PrimesByInitialFile.txt: Sorted by prime factor, across all files. This denotes each prime factor found and the first file in which
		that factor was found. Note: this file is generated by the Check.py program which reads Inc_1.txt through Inc_1200.txt and parses for
		the prime factors listed on the lines.

There are additional files that track how many ways a square number can be calculated with the formula. The files 
are Squares.txt and Squares_x.csv (x=1,2,...). The .csv files each contain 250,000 lines. 
For instance, the number 43681 (209 * 209) is generated by:
			13 * 14 * 15 * 16 + 1   (start = 13,diff = 1: 1^4)
			8 * 13 * 18 * 23 + 625  (start = 8, diff = 5: 5^4)
			5 * 13 * 21 * 29 + 4096 (start = 5, diff = 8: 8^4)
			1 * 14 * 27 * 40 + 28561 (start = 1, diff = 13: 13 ^ 4)

This is on line 42 in Squares_1.csv and line 44 in Squares.txt

Lastly: the file bigdictionary.txt lists all result (and their square roots) which can be generated by
more than one starting integer:difference. This is an unformatted report of the data in the Squares_x... files. 
The prime factors of the square roots are not listed.

The first number (before the colon) is the number of files that contain a sequence that generates the 
number. The group following the colon (e.g. [43681, 209]) is the generated number and its square
root. The groups (e.g. [13,1,8,5,5,8,1,13]) are a list of starting number:difference pairs.

The second part of bigdictionary.txt lists all of the numbers with an odd number of number/difference
sequences:

Notes:
	o	ProductOfFour.py will write to the Pof4_Output subdirectory. This subdirectory will be 
		within the directory where the ProductOfFour.py program exists. If the subdirectory
		does not exist it will be created.
		
		The directory name within the program will be valid for both linux and MS-windows.
	o	In the notes that follow, the resultant number is referred to as the product, when
		in the definition of the original sequence it is actually the sum of a 4 number product
		and a 4th power of an integer.

	o	The math involved:

		For number n, difference (increment) k:

		----
		Formula 1:
		----
		  n * (n+k) * (n + 2*k) * (n+3*k) + k^4
		= n* (n+2*k) * (n+k)*(n+3*k) + k^4
		= (n^2+2*k*n) * (n^2 + 4*k*n + 3*k^2) + k^4
		= (n^2*n^2 + 2*k*n*n^2) + (4*k*n*n^2 + 4*k*n*2*k*n) + (3*k^2 * n^2 + 3*k^2 * 2*k*n) +k^4
		= n^4		+ 2*k*n^3	 + 4*k*n^3	  + 8*k^2*n^2	 +	3*k^2*n^2	+ 6*k^3*n		 + k^4
		= n^4		+ 6*k*n^3				  + 11*k^2n^2					+ 6*k^3*n		 + k^4
		
		----
		Formula 2:
		----
		  (n*k + (n+k)^2)^2
		= (n*k + n^2 + 2*k*n + k^2)^2
		= (n*k + n^2 + 2*k*n + k^2) * (n*k + n^2 + 2*k*n + k^2)
		= (n*k*n*k + n^2*n*k + 2*k*n*n*k + k^2*n*k) + (n*k*n^2 + n^2*n^2 + 2*k*n*n^2 + k^2*n^2) + (n*k*2*k*n + n^2*2*k*n + 2*k*n*2*k*n + k^2*2*k*n) + (n*k*k^2 + n^2*k^2 + 2*k*n*k^2) + (k^2*k^2)
		= (k^2*n^2 + k*n^3 + 2*k^2*n^2 + k^3*n) + (k*n^3 + n^4 + 2*k*n^3 + k^2*n^2) + (2*k^2*n^2 + 2*k*n^3 + 4*k^2*n^2 + 2*k^3*n) + (k^3*n + k^2*n^2 + 2*k^3*n + k^4)
		= n^4 + (k*n^3 + k*n^3 + 2*k*n^3 + 2*k*n^3) + (k^2n^2 + 2*k^2*n^2 + k^2*n^2 + 2*k^2*n^2 + 4*k^2*n^2 + k^2*n^2) + (k^3*n + 2*k^3*n + k^*n + 2*k^3*n) + k^4
		= n^4 + 6*k*n^3 + 11*k^2n^2 + 6*k^3*n + k^4
		
		----
		Formula 3:
		----
		 (n^2 + 3*k*n + k^2)^2
		 = (n^2 + 3*k*n + k^2) * (n^2 + 3*k*n + k^2)
		 = n^4 + 3*k*n^3 + n^2*k^2 + 3*k*n^3 + 9*k^2*n^2 + 3*k^3*n + k^2+n^2 + 3*k^3*n + k^4
		 = n^4 + (3*k*n^3 + 3*k*n^3) + (n^2*k^2+9*k^2*n^2) + (3*k^3*n + 3*k^3*n) + k^4
		 = n^4 + 6*k*n^3 + 11*k^2*n^2 + 6*k^3*n + k^4


	o	As noted: the series with difference 1, as well as the series comprised of the square roots of the diff 1, diff 2, diff3 and diff 4 series, 
		are in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (oeis.org)

	o	When looking in squaresX.txt (X=1,2,3,...), the products formed by starting integer(n)=1, difference(k)=1 is not formed by any other 
		n:k combination. The same is true for n=2:k=2, n=3:k=3, ... n=10,k=10.  But n=11:k=11 is also formed by n=4:k=19 and n=19:k=4. The n:k 
		pairs continue 	as uniquely formed products until n=19:k=19, whose product 3,258,025 is also generated by n=41:k=1 and n=1:k=41. A quick 
		check shows that n=41:k=41 has a product also formed by n=11:k=76 and n=76:k=11. 

		Any number formed by an odd number of combinations will contain one instance of starting integer:difference being equal. Conversely: every starting 
		integer:difference of equal value (n=k) will have a result that has an odd number of n:k combinations. The lines containing the n=k
		in the squaresX.txt files are denoted with an asterisk(*).

	o	Question: is there any way to predetermine which result have an odd number of n:k,k:n combinations greater than 1?
																														
	o	for n=k, the square root of the result (s) is 5 * n^2. Proof: By formula 2, s=n*k + (n+k)^2). For k=n this becomes n^2 + (2*n)^2 = n^2 + 4*n^2 = 5 * n^2

	o	for n=k the product's square root is 5 n^2.  For n-1:k+1 and n+1:k-1 the product's square root is 5*n^2 - 1.  Proof: for k=n, n-1:k+1 = n-1:n+1. Again using Formula 2,
		the square root of the product is (n-1)*(n+1) + (n-1 + n + 1)^2 = n^2 - 1 + (2*n)^2 = 5*n^2 - 1 
	
	o	For every n=x,k=y pair that generates a number, there exists an n=y,k=x pair that generates the same number. Proof: Using Formula 2 (n*k + (n+k)^2)^2 for the sequence 
		it is easy to see that swapping n and k does not change the result. This shows that whenever a set of n:k combinations has an odd number of entries, then one of those entries must 
		be where n=k.

			-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				for the following product π = n * (n+k) * (n+2*k) * (n+3*k) and resultR = π + k^4
			-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	o	For n=x,k=1 no product has a prime factor of 2 or 3. Proof: π is divisible by both 2 and 3. Adding 1 means all results R are: R=1(mod2) and R=1(mod3)

	o	for n=x,k=1 no product has a prime factor of 7. Proof: for n=1(mod7) π=4(mod7) and R=5(mod7). For n=2(mod7) π=1(mod7)and R=2(mod7). For n=3(mod7)
		π = 3(mod7) and R=4(mod7). For n=4(mod7), 5(mod7), 6(mod7) and 0(mod7), π = 0(mod7) and R=1(mod7).

	o	for n=x,k=2 no product has a prime factor of 3. Proof: when π = 0(mod3) then R = π + 2^4 = 1(mod3). If n=0 mod(3), then π = 0(mod3). 
		If n = 1(mod3) then (n+2) = 0(mod3) and π = 0(mod3). If n=2(mod3) then n+(2*2) = 0(mod3) and P = 0(mod3).

	o	for n=x,k=3: no product has a prime factor of 2. Proof: π is even. Adding 81 makes the result odd. Odd numbers do not have 2 as a prime factor.

	o	Conjecture: In the Inc_1.txt file, note the first [1], second [2] and third [3] time a prime factor (pf) appears for a result R. Note n[1],n[2] and n[3].
					The next time that (pf) will appear will be at n[4] = n[3] + (n[2]-n[1]). n[5] = n[4] + (n[3] - n[2]). This repeats infinitely for each first
					occurence of a prime factor (pf).
					examples: 	(pf)=11:  n[1]=2, n[2]=6, n[3]=13.  n[4]=13 + (6-2)  = 17. n[5] = 17 + (13-6)  = 24.  n[6] = 24 + (17-13) = 28, ...
								(pf)=19:  n[1]=3, n[2]=13,n[3]=22.  n[4]=22 + (13-3) = 32. n[5] = 32 + (22-13) = 41.  n[6] = 41 + (32-22) = 51, ...
								(pf)=29:  n[1]=4, n[2]=22,n[3]=33.  n[4]=33 + (22-4) = 51. n[5] = 51 + (33-22) = 62.  n[6] = 62 + (51-33) = 80, ...
					The difference of n[m]-n[m-2] = (pf) for m >= 3.
		In other words: if p | n * (n+1)^2
						then p | (n + p - (2*n+3)) * 1 + (n + p - (2*n+3) + 1))^2
							 p | (n + p) * 1 + (n + p + 1)^2
							 p | (n + 2*p - (2*n+3)) * 1 + (n + 2*p - (2*n+3) + 1)^2

	For the following 4 bullet items, the generated .csv files contain columns for S[n], S[n]^.5 and S[n]+(R[n]^.5). Rather than use program run time
	for the S[n] calculations, ProductOfFour.py writes the Excel formulas for those values in each row.
	
	o	From https://oeis.org/A062938 comments: The sum of any three consecutive R, divided by 3, is a perfect square.  Thus (R[n-2]+R[n-1]+R[n]))/3 is
		a perfect square. This is also sequence https://oeis.org/A058031.
		For increment, k, = 1, let R[n] be the result n * (n+1) * (n+2) * (n+3) + 1 and S1[n] = ((R[n-2]+R[n-1]+R[n]))/3)^.5
		Examples:
			n = 4, S1[4] = ((R[2]+R[3]+R[4])/3)^.5 = ((121 + 361 + 841) / 3)^.5 = 441^.5 = 21
			n = 10, S1[10] = ((R[8] + R[9] + R[10])/3)^.5 = ((7921 + 11881 + 17161))^.5 / 3 = 12321^.5 = 111
			n = 30, S1[30] = ((R[28] + R[29] + R[30])/3)^.5 = ((755161 + 863041 + 982081) / 3)^.5 = 866761^.5 = 931
	o	(S1[n] + R[n]^.5) / 2 is the square of n+1	
		Examples:
			n = 4, S1[4] = 21, R[4]^.5 = 29  21+29 = 50, 50/2 = 25, 25^.5 = 5
			n = 10, S1[10] = 111, R[10]^.5 = 131, 111+131 = 242 242/2 = 121, 121^.5 = 11
			n = 30, S1[30] = 931, R[30]^.5 = 991, 991+931 = 1922 1922/2 = 961, 961^.5 = 31
		The sequence S1[n] + R[n]^.5 is sequence https://oeis.org/A001105

	o	For increment k=2. Let R[n] be the result n * (n+2) * (n+4) * (n+6) + 16,  S2[n] = ((R[n] + R[n-2] + R[n-4]) / 3)^.5. 
		Examples:
			n = 5, S2[5] = (R[5] + R[3] + R[1]) / 3)^.5 = ((3481 + 961 + 121) / 3)^.5 = 1521^.5 = 39 
			n = 11, S2[11] = ((R[11] + R[9] + R[7]) / 3)^.5 = ((36481 + 19321 + 9025) / 3)^.5 = 21609^.5 = 147
			n = 21, S2[11] = ((R[21] + R[19] + R[17]) / 3)^.5 = ((326041 + 229441 + 156025) / 3)^.5 = 237169^.5 = 487
	o	(S2[n] + R[n]^.5) / 2 is the square of n+2
		Examples:
			n = 5, S2[5] = 39, R[5]^.5 = 59, 39 + 59 = 98, 98/2 = 49, 49^.5 = 7
			n = 11, S2[11] = 147, R[11]^.5 = 191, 191 + 147 = 338, 338 / 2 = 169, 169^.5 = 13
			n = 21, s2[21] = 487, R[21]^.5 = 571, 487 + 571 = 1058, 1058 / 2 = 529, 529^.5 = 23
